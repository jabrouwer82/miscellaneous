Disclaimer: Many of these files were thrown together quickly for a singular specific purpose or were experiments with various syntax/styles. They were written sometime within the last 4 years, while I was learning how to program and were never intended to be maintained or extended. As such, do not expect quality comments, uniform style, or any other good practice within any file here. Check out my other repositories for that sort of thing.
